# encoding: output encoding for the file, Python 2.3+ users can use the
#           special "xml" value to output ASCII with XML character references
# locale: locale to use for (e.g.) strings in dates, default is taken from your

# Any other section defines a feed to subscribe to.  The section title

# have any of the following options:
# 
# name: Name of the feed (defaults to the title found in the feed)
#
# Additionally any other option placed here will be available in
# the template (prefixed with channel_ for the Items loop).  We use
# this trick to make the faces work -- this isn't something Planet
# "natively" knows about.  Look at fancy-examples/index.html.tmpl
# for the flip-side of this.
